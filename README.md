order_details.csv: Specific pizzas and quantities for each order.
pizzas.csv: Size and price data for each specific pizza variation.
pizza_types.csv   : Names, categories, and ingredients.

 TOOLS USED
Python: Primary programming language.
Pandas: For data manipulation and aggregation.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and reporting.
Matplotlib : For data visualisation

KEY INSIGHTS
Total Revenue: $817,860.05
Busiest Days: Fridays generate the highest sales, while Sundays are the slowest.
Peak Hours: The lunch rush (12:00 PM – 1:00 PM) is the busiest time of day.
